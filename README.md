# GDSC-project-updated
This project is a dynamic and interactive card layout designed for the GDSC Web Team. It leverages HTML, CSS, and custom animations to create a modern, responsive grid of cards, each representing different aspects like work, achievements, and personal interests. The layout adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, and each card has unique animations—such as pulse and float—adding a visually engaging, 3D effect on hover.

It includes features such as SVG Animation,Radial Gradient Hover Effect,Light Sweep Effect,Radial Growth Effect,Border Shrinking Effect and Sparkle Effect.
